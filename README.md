# Send_goals
Using prior knowledge of how to write a pub/sub node, I did a python script that take an input of x and y coordinates through the terminal and search for SimpleActionServer/Client of move_base and can send a goal through python script, using Rviz, Gazebo, ROS on linux and python to send one goal at a time and await goalsucceded flag.
