# Send_goals
Using prior knowledge of how to write a pub/sub node, I did a python script that takes an input of x and y coordinates through the terminal and searches for SimpleActionServer/Client of move_base and can send a goal through a python script, using Rviz, Gazebo, ROS on Linux and python to send one goal at a time and await goalsucceded flag.
